Zayn Malik is best known for being a part of the popular boy band One Direction. He has also enjoyed a highly successful solo career.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Zayn Malik, also known as Zain Javadd Malik, was born to Yaser and Tricia Malik in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, on January 12, 1993 and grew up in East Bowling. He graduated from Tong High School in Bradford. His school years were less than ideal, as his mixed Pakistani and Irish/English often made him the recipient of jokes and unkind behavior. Although he grew up in an Islamic household, Zayn no longer identifies as Muslim. As a teenager, he took performing arts courses and appeared in multiple school productions. He started writing raps during high school. Before he began his music career, he had planned to become an English teacher.</p><h2 id=one-direction><strong>One Direction</strong></h2><p>He auditioned for "The X Factor" because he was interested in the experience. He is a fan of rap and R&B, and cites <a href=# title="Bruno Mars Net Worth">Bruno Mars</a> as one of his favorite artists. He was not chosen to advance as a solo artist while on "The X Factor", but he was paired with four other musicians to form the boy band, One Direction. One Direction went on to become one of the most popular acts to ever be produced by a reality series.</p><p>Since forming in 2010, the group has sold more than 20 million albums worldwide. As of this writing, the group has released five studio albums. Between June 2013 and June 2014, the group generated $75 million in revenue. Between June 2014 and 2015, the group generated $130 million in revenue. Their "Where We Are" Tour generated $282 million, which is the second-highest gross for a vocal group in history. Their band is owned by a corporation called 1D Media that was formed in 2010 and is owned equally by the five members.</p><p>Zayn Malik departed the group in 2015. The band went on hiatus in January 2016 and each member has subsequently pursued solo careers that have been surprisingly successful. All five members of One Direction have released solo songs that have charted in the Top 40 in the United States. They are one of the few examples of a group act where the individual artists found success outside of the group.</p><h2 id=solo-career><strong>Solo Career</strong></h2><p>After his departure from One Direction in July 2015, Malik announced he had signed a recording deal with RCA records. He revealed that his new album would be named "Mind of Mine" on his first solo on-camera interview with <a href=# title="Zane Lowe Net Worth">Zane Lowe</a> for Apple Music's Beats 1. "Pillowtalk," the album's lead single, was released in January 2016. The track debuted at No. 1 in several countries, including the U Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100. The single propelled Malik to No. 6 on the Billboard Artist 100 Chart. He held the highest first-day and weekly streams for a debut artist worldwide. The second official single off the album, "Like I Would," reached No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. "Pillowtalk" was released in March 2016 and included tracks co-written by Malik and a team of professional songwriters. It reached No. 1 in several countries including the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the U.S., where he became the first British male solo artist to debut at No. 1 with his first album.</p><p>His next project came at the end of 2016 when he collaborated with <a href=# title="Taylor Swift Net Worth">Taylor Swift</a> on a single called "I Don't Wanna Live Forever," for the soundtrack of the film "Fifty Shades Darker." The track reached No. 2 in America, No. 5 in the UK, and No. 1 in Sweden.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-314787 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Zayn-Malik-1.jpg alt width=900 height=894 sizes="(max-width: 1429px) 100vw, 1429px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-314787 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</p><p>In April 2018, Malik released the lead single "Let Me" for his next album, "Icarus Falls." The album was released in December 2018 and received mostly favorable reviews from music critics, but was not as commercially successful as his first solo album. The lead singles also included "Still Got Time" and "Dusk Till Dawn." In 2019, Malik performed a cover version of "A Whole New World" with <a href=# title="Zhavia Ward Net Worth">Zhavia Ward</a> for the soundtrack to the 2019 film remake of "Aladdin." He followed this up with a collaboration on the electropop track "Flames," which he wrote and recorded with R3hab and Jungleboi. Their track was released in November 2019. In September 2020, Malik released the lead single "Better" from his third studio album "Nobody is Listening." The song marked his first solo release in almost two years. On January 8, 2021, he released "Vibez" and pre-order for the album. "Nobody is Listening" was released on January 15, 2021.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Malik supports the Manchester United Football Club. Malik is active in philanthropy, becoming an official ambassador of the British Asian Trust charity group. He donated his guitar in April 2014 to the Kean's Children Fund in Dundee, Scotland. In January 2020, Zayn donated Â£10,000 to the GoFundMe page of a five-year-old girl that had been set up by her mother to help pay for her medical treatment. Malik was an active and vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement in the spring of 2020.</p><p>Malik dated fellow X Factor contestant Geneva Lane from 2010-2011. At one time he was engaged to actress <a href=# title="Perrie Edwards Net Worth">Perrie Edwards</a>, whom he had been dating since 2012, but that relationship reportedly ended in August 2015. Malik has been involved in an on and off again relationship with American model <a href=# title="Gigi Hadid Net Worth">Gigi Hadid</a> since she appeared in his music video for the song "Pillowtalk." Malik and Hadid welcomed their first child, a daughter, together in September 2020, reportedly on a farm in rural Pennsylvania where the two had been quarantining together since May of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2012 Zayn paid $5 million for a home in North London. He listed this home for sale in September 2019 for $4.6 million. He may still own this property.</p><p>In 2015, Zayn paid $3.1 million for a home in LA's Bel Air neighborhood. He listed the home for sale in December 2018 for $3.5 million. He reduced the price to $3.2 million but was ultimately forced to accept a loss when he accepted $2.94 million in October 2019.</p><p>In 2018 he paid $10.7 million for a penthouse in the Soho neighborhood of Manhattan. The penthouse, one of three in the building, spans 3,600 square-feet of living space and features 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms. It also has a 1,000 square-foot private roof terrace.</p><p>He also owns a farm in rural Pennsylvania.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHy7rdinZKaZnJ64brrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzayn-malik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fzayn-malik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fzayn-malik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fzayn-malik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzayn-malik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzayn-malik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./audrey-hepburn-s-sons-recall-their-normal-upbringing.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./audrey-hepburn-s-sons-recall-their-normal-upbringing.html>Audrey Hepburn's Sons Recall Their 'Normal Upbringing'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-killed-tom-in-secrets-and-lies.html>Who killed Tom in Secrets and Lies?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-killed-tom-in-secrets-and-lies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
