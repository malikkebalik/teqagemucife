<time>05 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It is well knowledge that romance exists in certain shonen anime, but that it is rarely the show’s main focus. In addition to romantic subplots, it is well-known that much shonen anime feature at least one major antagonist. In Black Clover, however, rivalries are more pivotal than romantic entanglements.</p><p>In this post, we’ll look at one of the series’ most well-known rivalries, which features one of the show’s most popular characters, the formidable Mereoleona Vermillion. Find out who Mereoleona Vermillion’s adversary was and how their connection developed during the series by reading this article!</p><h2>Who is Mereoleona Rival?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Who-is-Mereoleona-Rival.webp><p>In the series, Mereoleona Vermillion’s only true adversary is Acier Silva, her original tutor and the one person she has never been able to win a fight against, no matter how much of an advantage she had or how powerful she actually grew.</p><p><strong>Mereoleona is a powerful Clover Kingdom princess.</strong> The fact that she can strike fear into the heart of even Yami is a testament to her strength. Mereoleona is not only a formidable Fire Mage, but also a formidable fighter.</p><p><strong>You can also take a look at the fight scene of Mereoleona in Black Clover below:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Mereoleona is one of my favorite Woman Anime characters of all time. This fight scene was insanity!! <a href=# rel=noopener>#BlackCloverSOTWK</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZCYHf7cHcn</a></p><p>— Re:animated (@ReanimatedYT) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 17, 2023</a></p><p>A strong member of the Silva House, Acier Silva commanded the Silver Eagle squad of the Magic Knights in their heyday. Despite being incredibly potent thanks to her Steel Magic trait, she met an untimely end at the hands of Megicula. When she passed away, she had only been alive for 33 years.</p><p>This post will continue to discuss Mereoleona Vermillion and his interactions with her first tutor, Acier Silva. We have a wealth of information on these individuals now, but those who haven’t seen every episode of Black Clover should be warned that there will be major spoilers. We’ll explain their connection in the first part of the post, and then tell you Acier’s backstory so you can grasp the significance of her character in the second.</p><p>Mereoleona Vermillion is widely regarded as one of the series’ most formidable protagonists. She is one of the most dangerous characters in the show because she is powerful and has many extraordinary skills. In addition, Mereleona possesses an exceptional will to battle, refusing to give up until she is completely defeated.</p><p>Eren Yeager is one of the favorite heroes of anime fans. He is the main character of Attack on Titan who wants to join the Survey Corps. <strong>But do you know what motivates him for revenge?</strong> Take a look:</p><h2>In the show, Acier Silva Endures a Trἀgic Plotline</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/In-the-show-Acier-Silva-Endures-a-Tragic-Plotline.webp><p>Now that you know how Mereleona and Acier are related, we can fill you in on some of Acier’s background. In her era, Acier served as the Silver Eagles’ captain. Acier was also Mereoleona Vermillion’s teacher when the latter was young; as we’ve seen, Acier was impervious to Mereoleona’s elemental advantage.</p><p>Sometime later, Acier settled down and started a family. Acier told her eldest son Nozel that he was the only one who had inherited her Steel Magic and that he would have to use it to protect his siblings when their fourth and last daughter Noelle was only a few days away. After giving birth to Noelle, Acier fought Vanica Zogratis and Megicula, earning a curse from the latter.</p><p>After threatening to kill Nozel and Noelle for disrupting the combat, Vanica spurred Acier to send in more troops and keep the battle going, when Vanica was mortally wounded; utilizing this opportunity, he cursed Acier and ran away.</p><p>Acier eventually died from the consequences of the curse after her fight with Vanessa. She was made to believe that giving birth to Noelle was the cause of her death in order to spare her family from the demonic curse’s ill repercussions.</p><p>If you want to read out more articles related to upcoming anime and their character details then you can join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdga3xyhY6mnKudn6GysLrAaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-mereoleona-rival-is-she-the-strongest-character-of-black-clover.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-mereoleona-rival-is-she-the-strongest-character-of-black-clover.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-mereoleona-rival-is-she-the-strongest-character-of-black-clover.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-mereoleona-rival-is-she-the-strongest-character-of-black-clover.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-mereoleona-rival-is-she-the-strongest-character-of-black-clover.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-mereoleona-rival-is-she-the-strongest-character-of-black-clover.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chesapeake-shores-season-7-showrunner-shared-what-might-have-happened-if-show-was-renewed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chesapeake-shores-season-7-showrunner-shared-what-might-have-happened-if-show-was-renewed.html>'Chesapeake Shores' Season 7?
