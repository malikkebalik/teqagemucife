The first hour-long Western on television, the show took place in the post-American Civil War era, and focused on the exploits of Walker's roaming cowboy hero. "Cheyenne" was a big hit, running for seven seasons through 1962 and turning Walker into a bonafide star known for his good looks and tall, buff figure. Walker also occasionally sang on the show, leading Warner Brothers to produce an album of him performing traditional songs and ballads.</p><h2 id=film-career><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p>Walker had his first credited film role in the 1956 Biblical epic "The Ten Commandments."

The same year, he starred in the horror television films "Scream of the Wolf" and "Killdozer!" Later in the decade, Walker starred in another horror television film, "Snowbeast." He also had a small part in the NBC miniseries "Centennial." In the 1980s, Walker appeared in some episodes of "The Love Boat." The next decade, his final one on screen, he appeared in the television film "The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw" as his famous character Cheyenne Bodie.
