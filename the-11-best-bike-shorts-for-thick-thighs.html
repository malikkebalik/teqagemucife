The best bike shorts for thick thighs are made of highly stretchy fabrics, with a mid-thigh inseam that prevents chafing and keeps them from riding up.</p><h2><strong>What To Consider When Shopping For The Best Bike Shorts For Thick Thighs</strong></h2><h4>Materials</h4><p>If you plan on <a href=# class=T3D>frequently working out in your bike shorts</a>, you’ll want them to be made of a moisture-wicking fabric — like nylon or polyester — that’s blended with 15% to 20% elastane or spandex for plenty of stretch. For more support — and to help<strong> </strong>stimulate circulation and boost muscle recovery — you can opt for a pair with 20% spandex or more, but keep in mind that some people with thick thighs may find that high-compression options feel a bit constricting, so they’re not the best for all-day wear.<strong> </strong>Also note that compression leggings may not be a good idea for people with certain medical conditions, so you might want to check in with your doctor before trying them out.</p><p>If you mainly see yourself wearing bike shorts for low-key activities, you might opt for <a href=# class=T3D>more casual shorts</a> with a lower percentage of spandex. Also keep an eye out for cotton if you plan on lounging, as it tends to have a softer, more relaxed feel (but just note that it may stretch out a bit more between washings).</p><h4>Inseam Length</h4><p>The inseam length refers to the distance from the upper thigh to the bottom of your shorts and could range anywhere from 3 to 10 inches. The length you choose ultimately comes down to personal preference, but if you’re looking to prevent chafing, opt for a longer inseam that hits your mid-thigh to keep friction at bay. (Longer inseams can also be a better option if you’re looking for <a href=# class=T3D>shorts that don’t ride up</a> while you walk, run, or ride your bike.) A good general rule is to look for an inseam length of 7 inches to 8 inches, but you can go for a 10-inch inseam if you want the short to hit slightly lower.</p><h2><strong>How To Wear Biker Shorts</strong></h2><p>One of the greatest things about the <a href=# class=T3D>best bike shorts</a> for big thighs is that you can wear them so many different ways. Here are a few styling ideas to get you started:</p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Athleisure: </strong></strong></strong>When you’re taking a midday walk or grabbing some post-yoga coffee, pair your bike shorts with a matching sports bra or crop top. Add your favorite pair of sneakers, and in colder weather, layer with a hoodie.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Dressy</strong></strong>-c<strong><strong>hic: </strong></strong></strong>Elevate your bike shorts by layering them with a tank top and blazer. Finish with a delicate necklace and a pair of heels.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>The “Princess Diana Outfit”: </strong></strong></strong>Diana, Princess of Wales, was a fan of bike shorts, often seen sporting them <a href=# class=T3D>with an oversized jumper and sneakers</a>. Borrow her iconic street style by pairing brightly colored bike shorts with a relaxed-fit sweatshirt and a pair of chunky trainers.</li></ul><h2><strong>Shop The Best Bike Shorts For Thick Thighs</strong></h2><p>In a hurry?
