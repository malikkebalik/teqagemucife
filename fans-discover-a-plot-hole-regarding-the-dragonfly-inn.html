Usually, fans can overlook them.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial plot holes</a>, in specific, are exceedingly common, but&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gilmore Girls</a>&nbsp;fans can’t let go of one glaring financial plot hole in the show’s seven-season run. How did Lorelai Gilmore open the Dragonfly Inn if she used her investment money from Richard Gilmore to pay for Rory’s Chilton tuition?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lorelai-gilmore-used-the-money-from-her-father-s-investment-to-buy-the-dragonfly-inn>Lorelai Gilmore used the money from her father’s investment to buy the Dragonfly Inn</h2><p id=par-2_70>In Season 3, Lorelai and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sookie St. James</a>&nbsp;decide to open an inn together. The best friends had been dreaming of the possibility for years and finally had the perfect property picked out. The well-time maturation of an investment made for Lorelai by Richard helped the plan along. Before putting in an offer on the property, Richard presented Lorelai with a check for $75,000, which she intended to use on the inn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dragonfly-Inn.jpg><p id=par-3_60>Later, it was suggested that she did, in fact, use the money to purchase the property. There is a big problem with the storyline, though. Lorelai had seemingly already used that money for a different cause. Did she have multiple checks for $75,000, or did the writers forget that she already used the cash to start a fight with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emily Gilmore</a>?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-earlier-lorelai-supposedly-used-that-money-to-pay-richard-and-emily-back-for-rory-s-chilton-tuition>Earlier, Lorelai supposedly used that money to pay Richard and Emily back for Rory’s Chilton tuition</h2><p id=par-4_59>Rory’s decision to go to Richard and Emily for help with Yale was made behind Lorelai’s back, but she had a good reason. Rory didn’t want Lorelai to spend the money from her investment on Yale instead of the Dragonfly. With financing for Yale secured, Rory told Lorelai she could use the money to purchase the inn with Sookie.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_96><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit users</a>&nbsp;see one big problem, though. Lorelai shouldn’t have had much money left to invest in the Inn or to pay for Yale, for that matter. When she was speaking to the Bursar’s office at Yale, she noted that she no longer had the $75,000 that prevented Rory from getting financial aid. She insisted she had already used the money. So, which was it? Did she earmark the funds for her business venture, or did she use the money to pay back Richard and Emily? It seems like a plot hole that was never fully explained.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-much-would-chilton-have-cost>How much would Chilton have cost?</h2><p id=par-6_74>So, if Lorelai used Richard’s investment money to pay the couple back for Chilton, she likely wouldn’t have had enough money to buy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Dragonfly Inn</a>. Some fans argue that she would have had money left over from the investment, even after paying for Chilton, which could have served as her down payment for the inn. Still, it hardly seems like the money would be enough to repay Richard and Emily and buy a property.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gilmore-Girls-7.jpg><p id=par-7_64>Rory started prep school as a sophomore in 2000 and graduated in 2003. That means Richard and Emily would have needed to foot the bill for three full years of school. Chilton wasn’t just an imaginary school, though. The elite prep school was based on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Choate Rosemary Hall</a>. Since Chilton was based on a real school, we can assume the tuition was about the same.</p><p id=par-8_88>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Niche</a>, the Wallingford, CT school charges $45,000 a year for non-boarding students for the current school year. Even 20 years ago, the tuition likely ran upwards of $20,000 per year. If Chilton cost $20,000 per year, Lorelai would have owed Richard and Emily $60,000 by the time Rory graduated. If that was the case, she would have had $15,000 left from her investment check after paying Richard and Emily. That hardly seems like enough to buy a property like the Dragonfly, no matter how dilapidated it was.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0qrjMqKmeZZeev62%2FjJ%2BYp6tdmba0r86vnKtlkWK9rbvTZp%2BopJViv6azwKuboqaXYsGpsYydqZqfn6OzrcWMoqWnZpipuq17</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffans-discover-a-plot-hole-regarding-the-dragonfly-inn.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffans-discover-a-plot-hole-regarding-the-dragonfly-inn.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffans-discover-a-plot-hole-regarding-the-dragonfly-inn.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffans-discover-a-plot-hole-regarding-the-dragonfly-inn.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffans-discover-a-plot-hole-regarding-the-dragonfly-inn.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffans-discover-a-plot-hole-regarding-the-dragonfly-inn.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./greg-maddux-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./greg-maddux-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Greg Maddux Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./these-celebrities-received-backlash-for-their-dreadlocks-way-before-zac-efron.html>These Celebrities Received Backlash for Their Dreadlocks Way Before Zac Efron</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./these-celebrities-received-backlash-for-their-dreadlocks-way-before-zac-efron.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
