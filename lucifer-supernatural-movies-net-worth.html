The ‘1992 Ford Models’ Supermodel of the World’ winner Tricia also worked as a model until 2002. But since then, she has been focusing solely on her acting career.</p><h2>Short Info on Tricia’s family and childhood</h2><p>Tricia Helfer, the renowned model, was born as Tricia Janine Helfer in Donalda, Alberta, Canada. She is the fourth daughter of her parents, <strong>Dennis</strong> and <strong>Elaine Helfer,</strong> who were both farmers. Her small family consists of her parents and three sisters:<strong> Trena, Tammy,</strong> and <strong>Tara</strong>.</p><p>Likewise, she used to work on the family’s grain farm with her sisters. And the young Helfer studied at William E. Hay Composite High School in Stettler, Alberta.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucifer’s Aimee Garcia- Age, Net Worth, Spouse, Supernatural, Instagram >></a></h4><p>But Tricia was discovered by a modelling agency scout at the age of 17. At that time, she was standing in line at a movie theatre with a relative of hers named Crystal.</p><p>Also, Tricia is American by nationality but belongs to German, English, Swedish, and Norwegian.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>There is no way we can question the beauty of Tricia, someone who worked as a former model. She was truly stunning when she was in her prime. But now, even at the age of 46, Helfer is not any less from her former self. This charming diva was born on April 11, 1974, under the sign of Aries.</p><p>As her sign suggests, Helfer is competitive, fierce, and attractive at the same time. Well, Tricia is all of that.</p><p>Nonetheless, this gorgeous former model is 5 feet 11 inches(180 cm) tall and weighs 58 kgs(128 lbs). Other than that, Helfer has a stunning figure, measuring 34-24-34 inches, giving her a perfect hour-glass shape.</p><p>Also, Tricia truly looked breathtaking in her short blonde hair and vivid blue eyes.</p><h2>Tricia Helfer started modelling at the age of 17</h2><p>As we all know, Tricia is not only an actress but a stunning model who held her position among the top for a decade. It all began when a modelling agent discovered her standing in a line. Not to mention, Helfer also won the Ford Models’ Supermodel of the World contest in 1992.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though she stayed active as a model for a decade from 1992 to 2002, she appeared in various projects and commercials. In that short time, Tricia appeared in ad campaigns for Ralph Lauren, Versace, Giorgio Armani, Chanel, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tricia-003.jpg><p>But Tricia’s work was not limited to a commercial model alone. With her glamorous physique, Helfer walked for many fashion designers and shows. Some of them include renowned fashion houses such as Carolina Herrera, Christian Dior, Claude Montana, Givenchy, John Galliano, Dolce & Gabbana, and more.</p><p>In the process, the young model also graced the covers of ELLE, Amica, Flare, Cosmopolitan, Maire Claire, Vogue, and a few others. Similarly, Helfer was a regular in Maxim Magazine and was ranked 57 on Maxim’s Hot 100 Women of 2007.&nbsp;</p><h2>Movies and TV Shows: Was Tricia Helfer in Supernatural?</h2><p>Despite being a successful model, what Tricia truly wanted to be was an actress. Hence, she left all the glory as a model and moved to Los Angeles to seriously pursue her acting career. Helfer’s first acting work was co-starring as Sarah on the television series Jeremiah.</p><p>Likewise, after committing to acting full-time, she starred as a model named <strong>Ashleigh James</strong> on the episode of CSI in 2002. The following year, Helfer starred as Number Six, a humanoid Cylon operative, on the Battlestar Galactica. The television series was written and produced by Ronald D. Moore and directed by <strong>Michael Rymer</strong>.</p><p>It is fair to say that role is still most remembered among others. Tricia won the Leo Awards for Best Lead Performance with two nominations for Scream Awards for ‘Best Breakout Performance’ and ‘Best Television Actress.’</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren German Age, Husband, Lucifer, Movies, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Then on May 31, 2006, Helfer began producing and hosting Canada’s Next Top Model. But to focus on Battlestar Galactica, Helfer did not host the second season of the show. That same year, she appeared in Spiral and The Green Chain.</p><p>Moreover, Helfer later starred in an episode on the second season of Supernatural and had a recurring role on CBS’ Two and a Half Men. Still active as an actress, Tricia has appeared in numerous small-screen and major screen such as The Collector, Them, Burn Notice, Chuck, Human Target, Dark Blue, Lie to Me, 17th Precinct, The Firm, Criminal Minds, Community, Killer Woman, Lucifer, Van Helsing, and many more.</p><h2>What is Tricia Helfer worth? Net Worth and Income</h2><p>It has been over a decade since Tricia decided to pursue acting. She left her successful modelling career and took a leap of faith, and what a decision it was. Eighteen years later, Helfer is one of the successful actress and host of television shows. As of 2020, this successful Canadian actress has accumulated a net worth of <strong>$10 million.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Helfer has appeared in successful movies and shows like Battlestar Galactica, Van Helsing, Lucifer, and more throughout her acting career. Not to mention, she also started as a successful model for brands like Chanel, Dior, and Armani to name a few.</p><p>Likewise, in 2011, Helfer purchased a<strong> $2.9 million</strong> house located in Beverly Hills. She later sold the house for <strong>$5.4 million</strong> to comedian <strong>Chris D’Elia</strong> in 2018. Tricia then purchased a <strong>$2 million</strong> new house in Sherman Oaks, California.</p><h2>Why did Tricia and Jonathan divorce?- Personal Life</h2><p>Already in her mid-40s, Tricia has gained much experience in the entertainment world and so in her personal life. This gorgeous Hollywood star was married to her then-husband <strong>Jonathan Marshall</strong>, a lawyer she met at a mutual friend’s birthday. After that, the two started dating and tied the knot in 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, after being together for over fourteen years, the two broke apart as Helfer filed for divorce in January 2018. She cited the reason as irreconcilable differences, and finally, the divorce was settled in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tricia-002.jpg><p>Since then, the actress has not been linked with any dating rumors. And from what we know, Tricia is still single and is not dating anyone either. But being single is not the main problem of Helfer at the moment.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiera Skovbye, Age, Movies, Dirty John, Net Worth, Husband, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Tricia co-founded the charity web site called “Acting Outlaws” with former Battlestar Galactica co-star <strong>Katee Sackhoff.</strong> Besides that, she is also involved in other charity events, including animal rescue and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Not to mention, she even appeared in a PETA video campaign in 2014, encouraging pet owners to keep their pets indoors, especially cats.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>–&nbsp; 1 million Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>–&nbsp; 225.9k Followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK5706ugnKGRYrWmuMWeqWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flucifer-supernatural-movies-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flucifer-supernatural-movies-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flucifer-supernatural-movies-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flucifer-supernatural-movies-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flucifer-supernatural-movies-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flucifer-supernatural-movies-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-situation-has-blown-10-million-is-now-suing-abercrombie-fitch.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-situation-has-blown-10-million-is-now-suing-abercrombie-fitch.html>The Situation has blown $10 million, is now suing Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lucasfilm-reportedly-plans-to-make-ahsoka-tano-bisexual-in-live-action.html>Lucasfilm Reportedly Plans To Make Ahsoka Tano Bisexual In Live-Action</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lucasfilm-reportedly-plans-to-make-ahsoka-tano-bisexual-in-live-action.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
