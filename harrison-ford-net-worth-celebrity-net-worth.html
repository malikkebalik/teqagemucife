As the legend goes, Harrison Ford was a struggling actor working as a carpenter to make a living, when he was cast in the role that would launch him into movie super stardom. While building cabinets for <a href=# title="George Lucas Net Worth">George Lucas</a>, he was asked to read opposite other actors coming to audition for a new project called, "Star Wars." His read was so good, that he was eventually cast in the role of Han Solo, and the rest is history.&nbsp; Post-"Star Wars," he went on to star in the blockbuster "Indiana Jones" franchise, as well as a steady string of commercially and critically successful stand-alone projects, such as, "Blade Runner," "Witness," "The Devil's Own," "The Fugitive," and "What Lies Beneath."&nbsp; He also played the character of Jack Ryan in "Patriot Games" and "Clear and Present Danger." Though his career throughout the late 90s and early 2000s was less than stellar, he has made a full resurgence in recent years, appearing in the commercially successful films, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," "Cowboys & Aliens," "The Expendables 3," "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," "Blade Runner 2049," and "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker." In 2023, he reprised the role of Indiana Jones in "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny." Three of Ford's movies are ranked in the top five box-office hits of all time.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Harrison Ford was born on July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois. He studied philosophy at Ripon College in Wisconsin. To get over a lifelong shyness, Harrison decided to take a drama class in the last quarter of his senior year. He quickly became hooked on acting. After graduating, he stayed in Wisconsin where he appeared in various local theater productions. In 1964 he traveled to Los Angeles, to audition for a radio voice-over job. He didn't land the gig, but he decided to stay in Los Angeles anyway.</p><p>He was eventually accepted into a new talent program at Columbia Pictures, which paid $150 per week. Between 1966 and 1973, he landed just a handful of tiny, and often un-credited, parts.</p><p>He had a wife and two young sons, so to support the family Harrison became a carpenter. By chance he actually did some carpentry work for George Lucas and <a href=# title="Francis Ford Coppola Net Worth">Francis Ford Coppola</a>. Through Coppola, Ford got on the radar of producer Fred Roos (a producer on The Godfather). Roos secured Harrison an audition for George Lucas' next project, American Graffiti (which was also being produced by Coppola). Harrison won the part and had a memorable turn as Bob Falfa. American Graffiti would go on to be one of the most-profitable films of all time, earning over $140 million on a budget of just $770,000. The success allowed Lucas to get financing from Fox to begin production on a space epic he had been dreaming up for years.</p><p>Harrison earned small but memorable parts in Coppola's 1974 film The Conversation and his 1979 film Apocalypse Now. But it was George Lucas' space epic that would turn Harrison Ford into an international superstar. That movie, as you may have guessed, was 1977's Star Wars.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-262381 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Harrison-Ford.jpg alt width=594 height=415 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-262381 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=star-wars><strong>Star Wars</strong></h2><p>Lucas initially hired Harrison to read with other actors during the casting process, but he eventually decided to cast him as Han Solo. After earning $500 per week on American Graffiti, Harrison earned $10,000 from Star Wars. That's the same as around $42,000 after adjusting for inflation.</p><h2 id=star-wars-earnings><strong>Star Wars Earnings</strong></h2><p>Harrison earned $100,000 for the 1980 sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, and $500,000 from 1983's The Return of the Jedi. Those two salaries after adjusting for inflation are worth the same as around $1.6 million in today's dollars.</p><p>Fast forward a few decades, and Harrison earned a base salary of $15 million to reprise his role as Han Solo in 2015's, The Force Awakens. He also had a small percentage of the box office gross which brought his total earnings from he film to $25 million.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-296225 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Harrison-Ford.jpg alt width=900 height=671 sizes="(max-width: 2013px) 100vw, 2013px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-296225 class=wp-caption-text>Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</p><h2 id=indiana-jones><strong>Indiana Jones</strong></h2><p>Aside from Han Solo, Ford is equally beloved for his role as Indiana Jones. His Indiana Jones debut came in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark. The second installment, Temple of Doom, came in 1984. The third installment, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, debuted in 1989. Unfortunately not much is known about Harrison's earnings for the first three Indiana Jones movies, however we do know he earned an enormous paycheck to reprise the role in 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. He had only appeared in four movies in the previous 8 years, preferring instead to live in semi-retirement. He returned to the franchise for 2023's "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny."</p><h2 id=kingdom-crystal-skull-payday><strong>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Payday</strong></h2><p>In order to lure Harrison out of retirement, studio Paramount Pictures agreed to fork over an extremely lucrative split of profits after it earned back production and advertising costs. The profits were essentially evenly split between the studio, Harrison and executive producers <a href=# title="Steven Spielberg Net Worth">Steven Spielberg</a> and George Lucas.</p><p>When it was all said and done, Harrison, George and Steven each earned $65 million from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. As of this writing, it's the <a href=#>12th-largest paycheck in acting history</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-330112 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Harrison-Ford-1.jpg alt width=900 height=592 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-330112 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Paramount/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=other-notable-salaries><strong>Other Notable Salaries</strong></h2><p>In the early and mid 1990s, Harrison consistently earned $10-12 million per movie. For example, he earned $9 million for 1992's Patriot Games and $10 million for the 1994 Jack Ryan sequel, Clear and Present Danger. In 1997 his salary jumped $20 million for The Devil's Own. He also earned $20 million for Air Force One, Six Days Seven Nights, Random Hearts and What Lies Beneath. Harrison earned $25 million plus 20% of the gross for 2002's K-19 The Widowmaker. It's been reported that Ford earned $25 million for "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" after taking a $40 million pay cut to reprise the role one last time.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Harrison was married to Mary Marquardt from 1964 to 1979. They had two sons together, including restaurateur Benjamin Ford. In 1983, Harrison married E.T. screenwriter <a href=#>Melissa Mathison</a>. They also had two children. When they divorced in 2004, Harrison paid Mathison a $90-100 million divorce settlement. It is one of the <a href=#>most-expensive celebrity divorces</a> of all time.</p><p>Harrison married actress <a href=# title="Calista Flockhart Net Worth">Calista Flockhart</a> in 2010. They began dating in 2002 after meeting at the Golden Globe Awards. They are parents to her adopted son Liam.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-233421 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/GettyImages-107985635.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-233421 class=wp-caption-text>Ian Gavan/Getty Images</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 1983, Harrison paid $1 million for a large home in LA's Brentwood neighborhood. He sold the gated 3/4-acre estate in 2012 for $8.2 million. In 2011 Harrison and Calista spent $12.6 million on a different Brentwood home which has been their longtime primary residence in LA. Property records show that he still owns at least three other homes in LA. These slightly more modest properties are either investments or occupied by family members.</p><p>In 2001, Harrison spent $5.3 million to acquire a penthouse in NYC's Flatiron District. He listed this property for sale in 2010 for $16 million, but ultimately pulled from the market. The penthouse is 5,500-square-foot, with 4-bedrooms and 4.5-bathrooms. The penthouse features an elevator, 11 rooms, state-of-the-art kitchen and security system, gym, office, and library. The floors are made of anigre wood and poured concrete, all equipped with radiant heat. At the top of the penthouse there is a 2,300-square-foot private rooftop terrace, complete with wet bar and views of Manhattan and the Hudson River.</p><p>In Wyoming, Ford owns an 800 acre ranch along the Snake River near the town of Jackson. He has donated half of the property as a nature reserve.</p><h2 id=private-planes><strong>Private Planes</strong></h2><p>Harrison is a somewhat notorious aviation buff/pilot. We say "notorious" because he has had a handful of incidents over the years including a crash onto an LA golf course and the time he made a dangerous landing on the a takeoff runway in Orange County. Harrison owns as many as 10 planes and a helicopter. His most impressive plane is a 2009 Cessna 680 which cost $18 million brand new. Harrison keeps his plane and helicopter collection at Santa Monica airport which is a roughly 10 minute drive from his Brentwood home. He can uber to the airport, hop on to his plane and fly himself to Wyoming in less than 20 minutes. And he has been known to do this quite frequently!</p><p>When in Wyoming He makes his helicopter available for fire and other emergency rescues. In 2000, Harrison answered the call of a stranded hiker who collapsed from dehydration. Wearing a tshirt and cowboy hat the hiker and a companion did not learn until later that their rescue pilot was the A-lister.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLWivtGiqqimXZu8s7CMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fharrison-ford-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fharrison-ford-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fharrison-ford-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fharrison-ford-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fharrison-ford-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fharrison-ford-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-guillermo-d%C3%ADaz-actor-make-latest-income-salary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-guillermo-d%C3%ADaz-actor-make-latest-income-salary.html>How Much Money Does Guillermo Daz (Actor) Make?
