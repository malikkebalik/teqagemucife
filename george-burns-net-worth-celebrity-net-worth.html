Burns and his wife co-starred on "The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show" from 1950 to 1958, and after Gracie retired due to heart problems, George starred in "The George Burns Show" from 1958 to 1959.</p><p>Burns had more than 60 acting credits to his name, including the films "The Big Broadcast" (1932), "Love in Bloom" (1935), "Oh, God!" (1977), and "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" (1978) and the television series "The <a href=# title="Jack Benny Net Worth">Jack Benny</a> Program" (1952–1963), "Wendy and Me" (1964–1965), and "George Burns Comedy Week" (1985).

Burns died of cardiac arrest in March 1996 at the age of 100.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>George Burns was born Nathan Birnbaum on January 20, 1896, in New York City. His parents, Hadassah and Eliezer, were Jewish immigrants who came to the U.S. from what is now known as Poland. Burns had 11 siblings, and his father was a coat presser as well as a substitute cantor at a synagogue. After Eliezer died of the flu in 1903, George helped support the family by running errands, shining shoes, and selling newspapers. At age 7, Burns got a job making syrup at a candy shop, and when he and his fellow child workers were bored, they often sang harmony in the shop's basement. After a few people heard them singing and threw them some money, the children formed the Pee-Wee Quartet and began singing "on ferryboats, in saloons, in brothels, and on street corners." George later took a job operating the curtains at a vaudeville theatre. In 1917, he was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War I, but he failed the physical due to his near-sighted vision. He adopted the stage name "George Burns" in an attempt to hide his Jewish heritage, and he said in interviews that he chose the name because of professional baseball players George J. Burns and George H. Burns, who were both playing at the time. In the early days of his career, Burns usually partnered with a woman, either for comic patter or a dance routine, but he didn't truly click with any of them until he met Gracie Allen in 1923. He said of that time in his life, "And all of a sudden, the audience realized I had a talent. They were right. I did have a talent—and I was married to her for 38 years."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-329124 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/George-Burns.jpg alt="George Burns Young" width=844 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-329124 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by NBC Studios/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>George and Gracie appeared in several short films in the late '20s and early '30s, then they starred in 1932's "The Big Broadcast," 1933's "International House," and 1934's "Six of a Kind."

After Allen's retirement, Burns starred on "The George Burns Show" from 1958 to 1959, and from 1964 to 1965, he played himself on the ABC series "Wendy and Me," which he also created.</p><p>George earned critical acclaim and two major awards for the 1975 film "The Sunshine Boys," then he played God in 1977's "Oh, God!," 1980's "Oh, God! Book II," and 1984's "Oh, God! You Devil." He guest-starred on "The Muppet Show" in 1977, and the following year, he co-starred with the Beatles in "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," playing Mr. Kite. George appeared in the films "Just You and Me, Kid" (1979) and "Going in Style" (1979) and the TV movie "Two of a Kind" (1982), and in 1985, he hosted "George Burns Comedy Week" on CBS. In 1988, he starred in the film "18 Again!," which was based on his 1980 hit "I Wish I Was 18 Again." In the '90s, Burns guest-starred as himself on "The Golden Palace" (1993) and "Phenom" (1994), and he made his final film appearance in 1994's "Radioland Murders."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356388 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/george-burns.jpg alt width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356388 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>George married dancer Hannah Siegel on September 5, 1917, because her family wouldn't let her go on tour with Burns unless they were married. They divorced in May 1918 after the tour ended. George then married Gracie Allen on January 7, 1926, and they adopted two children, Ronald and Sandra. Ronald played their son on "The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show," and Sandra occasionally appeared on the series as well. Burns and Allen remained together until Gracie died of a heart attack in 1964, and according to their associate Tom Fontana, "George was absolutely devastated — I don't think he ever recovered. After she was gone, he started sleeping on her side of the bed, because it made him feel closer to her." Burns suffered another loss in 1974 when his close friend Jack Benny passed away from pancreatic cancer. George gave a eulogy at the funeral, stating, "Jack was someone special to all of you, but he was so special to me … I cannot imagine my life without Jack Benny, and I will miss him so very much."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-190661 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-51975593.jpg alt="George Burns" width=594 height=443 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-190661 class=wp-caption-text>CARLOS SCHIEBECK/AFP/Getty Images</p><h2 id=final-years-death><strong>Final Years and Death</strong></h2><p>In honor of George's 90th birthday, Hamel Road in Los Angeles was renamed "George Burns Road," and for his 99th birthday, the city renamed part of Alden Drive "Gracie Allen Drive." Burns appeared at the unveiling ceremony, quipping, "It's good to be here at the corner of Burns & Allen. At my age, it's good to be anywhere!" Burns drove until he was 93, then he hired chauffeurs to drive him wherever he needed to go. In July 1994, he had surgery to remove fluid from his skull after he hit his head during a fall in his bathtub, and in 1995, he reportedly caught the flu at <a href=# title="Frank Sinatra Net Worth">Frank Sinatra</a>'s Christmas party. When he was 96, George signed a contract with Caesars Palace that included a show on his 100th birthday, but he wasn't well enough to perform that day.
