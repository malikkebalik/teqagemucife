It seems that someone had deliberately broken into his car just to lure him into a trap. And it’s more than one person that was involved in the kidnapping. A voice can be overheard on the 911 call checking in with what must be a third party.</p><p>The kidnappers probably thought they would snatch Westbrook long before he made a call to anyone much less to the police but because of their mistake – the BAU team was quickly notified and propelled into action. Generally kidnappings have a 72 hour window. If the victim isn’t found in that time frame then it’s most likely by the end of it the victim would be found dead if found at all.</p><p>So the police are pushing up their investigation. Meanwhile their UnSubs are taking their own sweet time with their victim. The two young men that kidnapped Westbrook have a plan. First they had wanted to toy with him. And they did so by filming him taking off all of his clothes. They had threatened to kill him if he hadn’t.</p><p>But what the UnSubs are saving for last, is Westbrook’s confession. They want him to admit to what he did. Specifically, what he did to them when they were young boys.</p><p>Westbrook is a pedophile. Not only did he use his position as a defense attorney sometimes volunteering to “help” out with the juvenile delinquents but he also used a secret second apartment to lure young boys. He provided them with candy, video games, and in return he took a couple of photos.</p><p>The team were looking at Westbrook’s defendants yet Morgan had informed them that a guy like Westbrook wouldn’t have poached so close to home. Men like Westbrook wouldn’t risk their careers for what they do on the side. And Morgan would know. He’s had experience with men like Westbrook.</p><p>However the team’s profile came too late to have been of any use. The two UnSubs that had kidnapped Westbrook has different versions of what they wanted to do to him. One of them had wanted to kill him and the other simply wanted his confession. But then they brought in a third friend. Another one of Westbrook’s victims.</p><p>They wanted him to see their revenge and he hadn’t agreed with any of it. He felt they should let Westbrook go. And so fight over the gun ensued and it resulted in the death of one of the original kidnappers. Then, after that, it was just two against one. So simply and yet nothing could be right after one of them died.</p><p>Brian was the one that hadn’t agreed to punishing Westbrook and when he accidentally killed his friend to keep him from killing Westbrook – he created an even bigger mess for himself. Andrew, his cohort, had told him they should burn the bodies. It would get rid of all the evidence. So while he left to get gasoline – Brian was left alone with Westbrook.</p><p>Westbrook thought he could manipulate Brian just like he used to. And it was working up until Westbrook revealed he knew Brian had become a pedophile like himself.</p><p>Brian was so scared his secret would come out – he killed his former tormentor. And then explained it away to Andrew. Said he didn’t have a choice.</p><p>Yet when the cops did finally arrive, Brian tried to claim Andrew was the one that killed Westbrook and their friend. Which was a lie the team instantly saw through. They had already found Brian secret stash of child pornography at his apartment. So they knew he would have the most to hide.</p><p>Although it broke Andrew when he heard his friend has become like the man they had all hated.&nbsp; Luckily Morgan was there for him. Morgan’s own experience of suffering sexual abuse allowed Andrew to identify with him.</p><p>Cases like these tend to set the parents amongst the team on edge but at the end of the day they feel like they’ve properly prepared their own kids to deal with these scenarios. But what newbie profiler Kate is about to find out – kids will always end up ignoring their parents’ good advice.</p><p>Her daughter sent a photo of herself to a man her friend had met online!</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG1nk6e2rrXNmqNmpZmjsbR50Z6amqhdZn5yhZBtZKydkai8r3mQaWSeqJmovKWxjHFkraCVYq%2BwxdJmpp9lo6qxuLvRrZ9mqJyWsKZ7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcriminal-minds-recap-the-boys-of-sudworth-place-season-10-episode-8.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcriminal-minds-recap-the-boys-of-sudworth-place-season-10-episode-8.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcriminal-minds-recap-the-boys-of-sudworth-place-season-10-episode-8.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcriminal-minds-recap-the-boys-of-sudworth-place-season-10-episode-8.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcriminal-minds-recap-the-boys-of-sudworth-place-season-10-episode-8.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcriminal-minds-recap-the-boys-of-sudworth-place-season-10-episode-8.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./eros-ramazzotti-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./eros-ramazzotti-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Eros Ramazzotti Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bitchy-russell-thomas-and-kim-cattrall.html>bitchy | Russell Thomas and Kim Cattrall</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bitchy-russell-thomas-and-kim-cattrall.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
