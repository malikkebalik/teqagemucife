Insider has verified her Airbnb's revenue with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>I have a background in law, and my husband has an engineering and construction background. But in 2020, we decided to branch into Airbnb ownership&nbsp;and bought our "Serenity Dome House," as we call it, in Joshua Tree, California, right before the pandemic as a deferred retirement job.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>In 2020, our revenue was up approximately 60% from the previous owner's 2019 earnings. In 2021, our revenue was up 87% from 2019. Today, we're trending about 55% higher than 2019 for 2022.</p><p class=premium>We live in San Diego and wanted to be within two hours' driving distance of the property. We searched surrounding SoCal areas, and we found that Joshua Tree was a good location to look into because it seemed to not have as many rentals and hotels at the time. I really wanted a dome house because I liked the architecture of them.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>There were only a handful of dome houses on the market during our search, but what really drew us to this particular one is that it doesn't have a second story or loft. When you go in there, it's a 1,000-square-foot circle with a tall ceiling. It feels like it has a bigger capacity.</p><h2 class=premium>Joshua Tree also had a lower buy-in compared to other places in Southern California</h2><p class=premium>At the time, the area had a much lower supply of rentals, so you could get a higher nightly rate because of the demand. That's quickly changing.</p><p class=premium>It was hard on the host front, especially because I had to learn how to be a host and have guests during COVID-19.</p><p class=premium>During the pandemic, everyone was running to the rural areas, so the demand was extremely high.<a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow> Investors started to come in, scrambling to buy every property and piece of land for&nbsp; development. Because of this, the supply has really gotten saturated</a>.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>Now, people are starting to do<a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow> international and big-city travel</a>. The demand here has dropped, and it's really changed the competition. There's also a lack of long-term rentals in Joshua Tree, so there's a<a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow> labor shortage</a>. People are moving away because they can't afford the area anymore.</p><p class=premium>Now you can't get house or pool cleaners, and everyone's fighting for the limited supply of labor. It's made hosting very challenging.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=premium>Despite all this, our house has been doing well&nbsp;</h2><p class=premium>We think it's because of its unique characteristics. We do see more bookings around spring break, and we're busy all through summer, too. In August, bookings seem to dip down some, and then it picks back up in September and October. Then it gets slower, but the holidays bring renters toward the end of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>During a weekday, we charge roughly between $395 and $450 a night for up to eight guests and $950 for up to eight guests on the weekend. We charge an extra $50 per night per guest after eight people. The max is 16 guests.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>We've found in this area that if you don't have a pool, you're dead in the summer. We've recently added a heater in the pool to stay a little bit busier and be able to charge higher rent per night in the off-season.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>My husband and I split the work. We both wear different hats, and then we share some of the hats, too. We each work about 10 hours per week on things related to the house. I think if we were to take out some of the extra tasks, like running the <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>social-media accounts</a>, we could drop our hours significantly.</p><p class=premium>We also don't have a property-management company, which makes being hosts more time-consuming.</p><h2 class=premium>Additionally, we've been doing a lot of remodeling and decorating</h2><p class=premium>We built from the ground up a two-bedroom addition to the dome house.</p><p class=premium>The dome can be difficult to maintain at times because there are so many different units involved with it, such as the pool and Jacuzzi. Unfortunately, guests also damage things. We've been lucky and haven't had any big blowouts, but we've had to fix gates, doors, paint, and décor. We've also had to replace the TV in every single unit. However, now we're buying higher-quality items, so they last longer.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>We also installed things that help us self-manage easily, like air conditioning that we can control remotely and a remote type lock so we don't have to drop off keys for new guests.</p><h2 class=premium>Sales have dropped since COVID-19</h2><p class=premium>I do a lot of analysis to determine our nightly rates. I look at Airbnb and see what other people are charging, because in Joshua Tree in particular — compared to other areas in Southern California — it seems hosts are adding one amenity after another. For example, hosts will add a hot tub, and then someone else will add a pool, and then someone else will have a pool and an outdoor bar.</p><p class=premium>The guests that are booking now are more price-conscious. There's a lot more price competition now than there was previously. It fluctuates per month depending on what time of year it is, so I never just set the price and leave it.</p><p class=premium>Since taking over the property, we've put a lot of thought into how to make it better and more profitable. For example, the house had a very high electric bill, so we added solar panels. The décor also looked like the previous host went to the thrift store and bought a bunch of different items that didn't look alike, so we got rid of all that, and we made sure everything goes together throughout the property.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>We've tried to reach a wider audience instead of just the hippie crowd. We wanted to appeal to families, yoga retreats, and other special events like birthday parties.&nbsp;Advertising&nbsp;to a wider group through social media has really helped us, especially since pretty much all of our bookings are for some kind of special event.</p><h2 class=premium>We always see Airbnbs referred to<strong> as 'passive income,' </strong>but there's nothing about it that's passive</h2><p class=premium>Even if you just hand the property off to a property manager, you're still paying bills. You might not be on call 24/7 for the guests, but there's still work to do.</p><p class=premium>I think that's why a lot of hosts are attracted to it. They're like, "Oh, it's passive. It's so easy for me to do it. Anyone can do it." A few years ago, the buy-in was easy, but with the prices now, you really have to be strategic to make money. In the market, if you buy at the current prices and you pay a property manager, you're not likely to see a positive return.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonyqec6wpWaZmaevr66Mnq%2BtqpFitq%2BvzqacZpyVqLKzwIydpqadXZ28tr%2FEZqGoq5iqrm7A0Z6cZmpgZ39uhA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-own-a-dome-house-airbnb-in-joshua-tree-for-extra-income.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-own-a-dome-house-airbnb-in-joshua-tree-for-extra-income.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-own-a-dome-house-airbnb-in-joshua-tree-for-extra-income.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-own-a-dome-house-airbnb-in-joshua-tree-for-extra-income.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-own-a-dome-house-airbnb-in-joshua-tree-for-extra-income.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-own-a-dome-house-airbnb-in-joshua-tree-for-extra-income.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kevin-hart-earned-an-absolutely-ridiculous-amount-of-money-last-year.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kevin-hart-earned-an-absolutely-ridiculous-amount-of-money-last-year.html>Kevin Hart Earned An Absolutely RIDICULOUS Amount Of Money Last Year</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-many-brother-and-sister.html>How Many Brother And Sister?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-many-brother-and-sister.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
