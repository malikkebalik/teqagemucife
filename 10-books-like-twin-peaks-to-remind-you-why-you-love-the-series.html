Because the series is bound to end — again — eventually, I've got 10 <a href=# class=T3D>books for you to read if you like Twin Peaks</a>, because you know you'll want something to pass the time in the wake of <a href=# class=T3D>David Lynch's return to television</a> on May 21.</p><p>For those of you not in the know, Twin Peaks aired in 1990 and 1991 before being unceremoniously canceled. Ratings declined in the second season as producers pushed up the series' big reveal: <a href=# class=T3D>Who killed Laura Palmer?</a> Regardless, everyone's psyched to see their favorite characters on screen again.</p><p>Twin Peaks takes place in the titular Washington logging town, where everyone has a few secrets lurking in their closets. The story centers on F.B.I. Agent Dale Cooper, who arrives to investigate the murder of Laura Palmer, the homecoming queen next door. Cooper's examination reveals that all is not well in Twin Peaks, where local business-owners run across-the-border brothels, and mystic visions haunt receptive outsiders.</p><p>Twin Peaks is a series like no other, which is why it has had a lasting influence on creatives of a certain niche. The 10 <a href=# class=T3D>books for Twin Peaks fans</a> below capture the essential elements of Lynch's short-lived show, from small town intrigue to brushes with the unknown.
