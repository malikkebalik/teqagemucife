<time>30 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p id=par-1_53>Police crime <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV shows</a> have been around for decades. Viewers enjoy watching the characters face conflicts at work and in their personal lives. However, viewers may be more critical of cop shows after the protests against police brutality in 2020. In fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cops got canceled</a> last year, and Live PD might not return.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_62>Still, some people fondly remember their favorite police crime dramas. A well-known one from the late-’70s is CHiPs. The show starring Erik Estrada and Larry Wilcox as California Highway Patrol officers also saw several other actors appear during its run. One was Denise DuBarry, who guest-starred as Sue on the show. And a couple of years ago, the actress tragically passed away.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chips-followed-two-motorcycle-cops>‘CHiPs’ followed two motorcycle cops</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CHiPs-Larry-Wilcox-Erik-Estrada.jpg><p id=par-3_47><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV crime dramas</a> are popular among viewers. NYPD Blue and The Wire probably come to mind, but&nbsp;CHiPs was poular in the late ’70s and early ’80s. CHiPs&nbsp;debuted in 1977 on NBC and ran for six seasons. There was also a reunion TV film in the late ’90s.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_39>The premise focused on two motorcycle patrolmen’s daily lives. They monitored freeways in and around the LA area. Episodes featured traffic incidents, criminal investigations, 911 emergencies, and some humorous situations. At the center was always a good-guy, bad-guy dichotomy.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_43>The two main characters were the rambunctious Officer Frank “Ponch” Poncherello&nbsp;and his more serious partner, Officer Jon Baker. Actor Erik Estrada portrayed Frank, and he also produced episodes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a> reports. Some viewers might recognize him from Sealab 2021. Larry Wilcox played Officer Baker.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-denise-dubarry-s-role-on-chips>Denise DuBarry’s role on ‘CHiPs’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_57>Actress Denise DuBarry played small roles on CHiPs and other ’70s and ’80s TV shows and movies. She was born on March 6, 1956, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a> reports. DuBarry lived in Texas for a short time before she moved with her parents to Louisiana. The future actress would move several times throughout Latin America and California as a child.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_52>At the age of 18, DuBarry took acting lessons and was later cast in the TV movie Deadman’s Curve. She also starred as nurse Samantha Greene Moore in the show Black Sheep Squadron. And she guest-starred in a 1981 episode of the ’70s sitcom The Love Boat, which often featured <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">B-list celebrities</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_40>DuBarry also appeared as a minor character in a couple of episodes of CHiPs in 1978 and 1979. She played Sue in the episode “Family Crisis.” The story centers on Ponch suspecting his partner’s nephew of riding in stolen cars.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_28>Later, DuBarry returned to play the same character in “Rally ‘Round the Bank.”&nbsp;The episode is about Ponch getting a visit from his mother while investigating drive-in bank robberies.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dubarry-s-tragic-death>DuBarry’s tragic death</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-10_40>It’s always sad to hear when an actor dies. For example, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Garrison passed away</a> soon after he reprised his role as Tommy in Cobra Kai. Those who enjoyed DuBarry’s work may be sorry to hear of the actress’s death.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_41>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, DuBarry died at the age of 63 on March 23, 2019. She had been admitted to the UCLA Medical Center due to a rare fungus. The exact type of fungus or how long she had it remains unknown.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_47>Many TV viewers remember DuBarry for her appearances on shows like Charlie’s Angels and CHiPs. Besides acting, DuBarry was also a philanthropist. She worked with a nonprofit that supported abused and at-risk children. The actress also was the president of Palm Springs Women in Film and Television.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_41>“For me, she was like a very classy businesswoman,” film producer Kim Waltrip told <a href=#>Desert Sun</a> of Dubarry. “She was ahead of her time in terms of women supporting women … She was an entrepreneur, and she was kind to everyone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwqbXPrGSsrJGneqWxwK2fZp6ipLpurYyrmKudXZ67p7HCraCopl6dwa64jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchips-star-s-strange-death-from-a-rare-infection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchips-star-s-strange-death-from-a-rare-infection.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchips-star-s-strange-death-from-a-rare-infection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchips-star-s-strange-death-from-a-rare-infection.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchips-star-s-strange-death-from-a-rare-infection.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchips-star-s-strange-death-from-a-rare-infection.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./colon-cruise-discover-cruises-to-colon-panama.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./colon-cruise-discover-cruises-to-colon-panama.html>Colon Cruise: Discover Cruises to Colon Panama</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./you-won-t-believe-the-crazy-story-of-how-ups-was-founded.html>You Won't Believe The Crazy Story Of How UPS Was Founded</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./you-won-t-believe-the-crazy-story-of-how-ups-was-founded.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
