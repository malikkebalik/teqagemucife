<time>13 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p id=par-1_64>Hollywood has had its fair share of celebrity romances, breakups, and makeups over the years. So much so that it’s hard keeping track of who’s dated who in the entertainment industry. While some celebrities make their romances know to the public, others prefer keeping their <a href=#>relationships</a> out of the spotlight. One couple who was good at doing that was <a href=#>Heath Ledger</a> and <a href=#>Michelle Williams</a>.</p><p id=par-2_42>Though the pair were often spotted out together, they rarely spoke about their relationship publicly. But despite keeping the details of the romance under wraps, Ledger and Williams appeared to have the ideal relationship — that is until things started heading south.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Heath-Ledger-and-Michelle-Williams.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heath-ledger-and-michelle-williams-relationship-began-like-a-storybook-romance>Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams relationship began like a storybook romance</h2><p id=par-3_15>Ledger and Williams first met in 2004 on the set of their film Brokeback Mountain.</p><p id=par-4_21>In 2012, Williams opened up about her first encounter with Ledger, admitting to <a href=#>GQ</a> that she was instantly drawn to him.</p><p id=par-5_48>“Our initial meeting, the circumstances of how we first met, were cosmic or something,” she told the outlet. “Yeah, a lot of things happened at once. It’s a bit like, we had a lot of things to do because we didn’t have a lot of time, or something.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_27>The pair, who starred as husband and wife in the romantic drama, bonded while filming a sledding scene that ended with a torn ligament in Williams’ knee.</p><p id=par-7_18>Soon, their chemistry had become undeniable. Even Ledger and Williams’ castmates could see a relationship blossoming between them.</p><p id=par-8_28>“I remember being in rehearsal, and the two of them had googly eyes with each other,” co-star Jake Gyllenhall confessed, according to <a href=#>E! News</a>. “There were sparks immediately.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heath-ledger-and-michelle-williams-were-together-for-three-years>Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams were together for three years</h2><p id=par-9_9>While filming Brokeback Mountain, Ledger and Williams began dating.</p><p id=par-10_25>Not long afterward, the couple welcomed their daughter Matilda Rose (born in October 2005) and had settled into a row home in Brooklyn’s Boerum Hill.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_28>Though they were two of the biggest celebrities in Hollywood at that time, the duo didn’t let their fame stop them from living like any other Brooklyn couple.</p><p id=par-12_35>While Ledger skateboarded through the neighborhood, Williams threw fundraisers for a local anti-development group. But despite their careers and side hobbies, the couple always made time in their schedules to take care of their daughter.</p><p id=par-13_38>“When Michelle is working, I’m the manny, and when I’m working, she’s the nanny,” the Dark Knight star explained in 2006 (per E! News), adding that family is “everything” to him and “the most important thing” he does.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Heath-Ledger-and-Michelle-Williams-1.jpg><p id=par-14_15><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href=#><strong>‘The Dark Knight’: Heath Ledger’s Joker Was So’ Stunning’ Michael Caine Forgot His Lines</strong></a></p><p id=par-15_37>However, not long after that, things began to change as they started growing distant from each other. Then in September 2007, media outlets revealed that the couple had called it quits after just three years of dating.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-michelle-williams-and-heath-ledger-broke-up-because-of-his-drug-use>Michelle Williams and Heath Ledger broke up because of his drug use</h2><p id=par-16_48>Though their romance started out perfect, it quickly unraveled due to Ledger’s partying and drug use. According to People (per <a href=#>Access</a>), the 10 Things I Hate About You star’s hard-partying ways created a rift between him and Williams, ultimately causing her to pull the plug on their relationship.</p><p id=par-17_49>“He had a lifestyle that really wasn’t — at least in Michelle William’s eyes — compatible with raising a child and continuing in that relationship,” People Senior Editor JD Heyman shared. “Even though their relationship did not work out, she did love Heath — she loved him very much.”</p><p id=par-18_36>While news of their breakup was sad to hear, some were convinced the couple’s split would only be temporary. Even Williams’ best friend Busy Philipps felt like “it wasn’t the end of the story for them.”</p><p id=par-19_52>“They were so young and that baby was the light of both of their lives. They were just working all the time and it was complicated,” Philipps <a href=#>wrote</a> in her 2018 memoir This Will Only Hurt a Little. “Sh*t is always complicated. Especially when you’re twenty-eight. And movie stars. With a baby.”</p><p id=par-20_25>But according to a friend of the couple, they were just way too different and thought it would be best to live their lives separately.</p><p id=par-21_51>“In the end, there were too many differences,” the friend revealed, according to <a href=#>Who.com</a>. “She kind of turned her head to those at the beginning, but when Matilda was born was really when she started to reevaluate things. I don’t think they fell out of love; it was probably tough love,”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-michelle-williams-never-stopped-loving-heath-ledger>Michelle Williams never stopped loving Heath Ledger</h2><p id=par-22_33>Unfortunately, Williams and Ledger never got the chance to give love another try because, on January 22, 2008, the Monster’s Ball actor died of an accidental overdose inside his New York City apartment.</p><p id=par-23_29>Fans and celebrities were left devastated over the news of Ledger’s death. But their grief was nothing compared to that of Williams, who was profoundly affected by his passing.</p><p id=par-24_36>Though she took a break from acting to grieve in private, she ultimately pushed herself to come to grips with this tragic loss. She also helped her daughter Matilda come to grips with the loss too.</p><p id=par-25_18>Although it’s been more than a decade since Ledger’s death, Williams is still reminded of him every day.</p><p id=par-26_23>“Every time I really miss him and wonder where he’s gone, I just look at [Matilda],” the Dawson Creek actor <a href=#>shared</a> in 2009.</p><p id=par-27_14>She also makes sure that she keeps Ledger’s memory alive for her daughter’s sake.</p><p id=par-28_84>“I am the mother of the most tender-hearted, high-spirited, beautiful little girl who is the spitting image of her father,” Williams said in a <a href=#>statement</a> following Ledger’s death. “All that I can cling to is his presence inside her that reveals itself every day. His family and I watch Matilda as she whispers to trees, hugs animals, and takes steps two at a time, and we know that he is with us still. She will be brought up in the best memories of him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2r7%2FInZxmoJWWwal5y56boJ2iYq6vsIymoJyglaG5pnnWoqOloZGiwG7A0Zqeoptdp7yurc2cnGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-heath-ledger-and-michelle-williams-tragic-romance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-heath-ledger-and-michelle-williams-tragic-romance.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-heath-ledger-and-michelle-williams-tragic-romance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-heath-ledger-and-michelle-williams-tragic-romance.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-heath-ledger-and-michelle-williams-tragic-romance.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-heath-ledger-and-michelle-williams-tragic-romance.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-yo-yo-ma-in-glass-onion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-yo-yo-ma-in-glass-onion.html>Is Yo-Yo Ma in Glass Onion?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tiger-woods-mistress-rachel-uchitel-reveals-exact-details-of-her-multi-million-payout-amidst-bitter.html>Tiger Woods' Mistress Rachel Uchitel Reveals Exact Details Of Her Multi-Million Payout Amidst Bitter</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tiger-woods-mistress-rachel-uchitel-reveals-exact-details-of-her-multi-million-payout-amidst-bitter.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
