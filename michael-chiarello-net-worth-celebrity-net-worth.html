Michael came from an Italian-American family, and according to his official website, "From his earliest childhood experiences – created around his mother's California kitchen with his extended Italian family of butchers, cheesemakers and ranchers – Michael Chiarello dreamed of becoming a chef one day." He attended the Culinary Institute of America, graduating in 1982. Michael then enrolled at Florida International University to study hospitality management, and he earned a bachelor's degree in 1984.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 1985, Chiarello opened The Grand Bay Hotel in Florida, followed by Toby's Bar and Grill, and "Food & Wine Magazine" named him Chef of the Year. He later moved back to California, settling in the Napa Valley. He took a job as a chef at The Heritage Restaurant, and after it went bankrupt, he opened Tra Vigne restaurant. Michael was the executive chef at several restaurants, such as Ajax Tavern (Aspen, Colorado), Caffe Museo (San Francisco, California), and Bistecca Italian Steakhouse (Scottsdale, Arizona).

Chiarello had a son named Aidan with his second wife, Eileen Gordon, who he married in 2004. Michael filed for divorce from Eileen in 2019. In March 2016, two of Chiarello's former employees filed lawsuits against him, alleging that he had committed labor law violations and sexual harassment. The sexual harassment lawsuit was settled in 2017. In November 2016, Michael was arrested for "suspicion of DUI and possession of a controlled substance" in Napa County. He was released a few hours later after paying $5,000 bail.</p><h2 id=death><strong>Death</strong></h2><p>On October 6, 2023, Michael died at the age of 61 after he was hospitalized for an allergic reaction at Napa's Queen of the Valley Medical Center. The cause of his death was anaphylactic shock, and a Gruppo Chiarello representative told "People" magazine a few days after Michael's death, "The doctors don't know what caused the allergic reaction and neither does the family. They may never know." After Chiarello's death, his family released a statement reading "We deeply mourn the loss of our beloved patriarch Michael. His culinary brilliance, boundless creativity, and unwavering commitment to family were at the core of his being. He brought people together through the joy of shared meals, fostering lasting memories around the table. As we navigate this profound loss, we hold dear the moments we cherished with him, both in his kitchens and in our hearts. His legacy will forever live on in the love he poured into every dish and the passion he instilled in all of us to savor life's flavors." Chiarello's family asked that in lieu of flowers, mourners make donations to Meals on Wheels in honor of Michael, "ensuring his commitment to culinary excellence and sustainability lives on."</p><h2 id=awards><strong>Awards</strong></h2><p>In 2005, Michael won a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Service Show Host for "Easy Entertaining with Michael Chiarello." He was named Chef of the Year by "Food & Wine Magazine" in 1985, the Culinary Institute of America in 1995, and "Esquire" magazine in 2013, and the Culinary Institute of America honored him as one of its Alumni of the Year in 2010.
