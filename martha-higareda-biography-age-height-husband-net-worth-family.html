The movie quickly became the second biggest box office record of its time. This caught the attention of the American Studios. "I wanted not only to be in movies, but to know the guts of the industry. Making movies it's all a team effort, so if you surround yourself with the best people you learn from them and then if you can also give an opportunity to those whom you believe in their talent, magical things happen"</p><p>She went back to her country with three finished scripts and at the age of 25 she wrote and produced her first independent film, Te presento a Laura.

The movie produced by Columbia Pictures was a huge success in which Higareda portrayed punk stubborn yet sweet Adela, her unusual haircut and fashion statement quickly became a trend in Mexican teenagers.</p><p>She booked her first American movie in 2007 Borderland where she shared credits with <a href=#>Brian Presley</a> and <a href=#>Beto Cuevas</a> produced by Lionsgate. The movie was screening in the American Film Market when an Agent approached her, he introduced Martha to Craig Shapiro, whom to this day represents Higareda at ICM Partners.
