Jennings, who was introduced to viewers everywhere in 2015 when she began starring in her own reality TV series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I Am Jazz</a>, has gone through many trials and tribulations all in the public eye. Things haven’t always been easy for the young pop culture icon, but through it all, she’s been able to count on the support of her family, including her grandparents, both of whom have been featured presences on the reality show.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-2_93>Jazz Jennings was born in South Florida in 2000, to parents Greg and Jeanette Jennings. The family has been open about the fact that the last name “Jennings” is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pseudonym that they assumed</a> in order to protect the privacy of their children. Jazz Jennings was diagnosed with gender dysmorphia when she was five years old, becoming one of the youngest people to go public as a transgender person. In 2015, I Am Jazz debuted on television, introducing fans to not only the young activist, but to her large, loving family as well.</p><p id=par-3_73>Jazz Jennings has three siblings in total, an older sister named Ari Jennings and two brothers, Sander and Griffen Jennings. She also has a set of grandparents who have become fan-favorites on the reality show, Jack and Jacky Jennings. While everyone in Jazz Jennings’ family has different personalities and interests, they have all been able to rally around the reality star, helping her to navigate life in the spotlight as a transgender person.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jazz-Jennings.jpg><p id=par-4_84>Jack and Jacky Jennings have been featured on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I Am Jazz</a> on more than one occasion, and often in unexpected ways. Memorably, in early 2020, Jack Jennings appeared in a drag show hosted by Jazz Jennings, which she organized to help pay for her friend’s gender confirmation surgery. “Let me tell you, we all have a little bit of the opposite sex in us,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Jennings admitted</a> on I Am Jazz, in advance of his drag performance. “I’m excited to see what comes out.”</p><p id=par-5_75>In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clip from the show</a>, Jack Jennings takes the stage in long pigtails and a red dress, seemingly having a great time. His wife Jacky Jennings admitted, “The drag show is one of the highlights of our being together for so long,” while Griffen Jennings joked that “I can’t say that Grandpa is the prettiest drag queen, I won’t give him that. But he definitely is the best sport out of all of us.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_47>Jazz Jennings and her grandfather have a good relationship, but they haven’t always agreed on every issue related to the transgender community. Notably, in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2017 episode of I Am Jazz</a>, Jazz and Jack Jennings sat down for a discussion with members of the trans community.</p><p id=par-7_46>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>, an audience member opened up about how he was born female, but he doesn’t feel like a female, saying, “I’m afraid of the hormone situation.” Jack Jennings responded, noting “I can’t imagine how one could go through a transition without the appropriated hormones.”</p><p id=par-8_52>Jazz Jennings took issue with her grandfather’s remark, telling the audience member “Yeah, I disagree with that. If it’s not important to you, don’t do it. Don’t listen to my grandpa.” Jazz and Jack Jennings continued to go back and forth on the topic, with Jazz Jennings later telling the cameras</p><p id=par-9_47>“I think my grandpa really does try to understand situations like this, but he ends up shooting himself in the foot. And I don’t think I want to argue with him anymore. It’s not worth it….if he’s right, then he’s right. Because otherwise … He’s right.”</p><p id=par-10_40>Ultimately, the two have a close relationship, with Jack Jennings willing to go out of his way to support Jazz Jennings in any way that she needs it – even if he doesn’t always know the right thing to say.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3osbZZqGepp6eu6h5xquYp5yglr%2BmutOsZKWdkae7bq3BqKytZZenrq%2Bwz5pko5mToHqovsCnm6aZXZ%2BupLfYZ5%2BtpZxk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flearn-all-about-the-i-am-jazz-star-s-grandpa-jack-and-grandma-jacky.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flearn-all-about-the-i-am-jazz-star-s-grandpa-jack-and-grandma-jacky.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flearn-all-about-the-i-am-jazz-star-s-grandpa-jack-and-grandma-jacky.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flearn-all-about-the-i-am-jazz-star-s-grandpa-jack-and-grandma-jacky.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flearn-all-about-the-i-am-jazz-star-s-grandpa-jack-and-grandma-jacky.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flearn-all-about-the-i-am-jazz-star-s-grandpa-jack-and-grandma-jacky.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-meaning-of-always-forward-in-luke-cage-is-a-call-to-action-for-black-viewers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-meaning-of-always-forward-in-luke-cage-is-a-call-to-action-for-black-viewers.html>The Meaning Of &amp;quot;Always Forward&amp;quot; In 'Luke Cage' Is A Call To Action For Black Viewers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./forty-prolific-wikipedia-editors-have-decided-to-leave-and-make-their-own-site-but-why.html>Forty prolific Wikipedia editors have decided to leave and make their own site, but why?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./forty-prolific-wikipedia-editors-have-decided-to-leave-and-make-their-own-site-but-why.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
