Nine of them were very well known,” says producer Mark Johnson. “We went around with a video camera and looked for people that were working and interrupted them from their movies, and some of them were really, really, really great. But when Ms. McAdams came in and read, it was apparent that she was the one.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_31>“It was the best audition experience I’ve ever had,” said McAdams. “And I just walked out of that room, and I was in another world. I just couldn’t catch my breath…”</p><p id=par-7_18>And because their chemistry was so great, it led to some tremendous on-screen kisses that Gosling called “Magic.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-gosling-gushed-about-his-on-screen-kiss-with-rachel-mcadams-in-the-notebook>Ryan Gosling gushed about his on-screen kiss with Rachel McAdams in ‘The Notebook’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-8_46>Gosling was quick to praise his co-star when he was asked about her kissing skills. He said (according to <a href=#>Stylist</a>,) “You have to be born with a magic mouth. Some have said about Rachel that she’s kind of like what Jimi Hendrix was to the guitar.”</p><p id=par-9_8>And what did McAdams say about the kiss?</p><p id=par-10_29>When she was asked during a press junket whether Gosling was the best kiss she had on-screen, she said, “In my lifetime? So far? It was pretty good, yeah.”</p><p id=par-11_17>And according to director Nick Cassavetes, he believes Gosling and McAdams started dating after the lip-locking scene.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-12_34>“These kids were on each other, and I think that a lot of it was character, but a lot of it was… They wound up together for many years after the movie,” he said.</p><p id=par-13_52>“I don’t know if I’m proud of it, but I think it’s fantastic that they found each other like that,” <a href=#>said</a> Cassavetes. “And I think that was the moment, because they weren’t together before that kiss. But they were together after that kiss, so maybe that was one of the deciding moments.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rachel-mcadams-and-ryan-gosling-were-madly-in-love-just-like-allie-and-noah>Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling were madly in love, just like Allie and Noah</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-6></figure><p id=par-14_23>It turns out the two enjoyed kissing each other so much that they went on to date for two years following The Notebook.</p><p id=par-15_13>And according to Gosling, their relationship was way more romantic than The Notebook.</p><p id=par-16_52>“God bless The Notebook,” he <a href=#>said</a>. “It introduced me to one of the great loves of my life. But people do Rachel and me a disservice by assuming we were anything like the people in that movie.
