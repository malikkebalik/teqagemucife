Well prepare yourself because either they’re going to make up or officially break up on next week mid-season finale. <a rel=nofollow href=#>On last night’s episode</a>, Meredith was finally laying off of Cristina. She was almost nice to her after hearing about Cristina’s complications during surgery. This is significant when you take in the fact Meredith was the primarily instigator for their fight. She went too far before and when it came time to be nice the guess what? Cristina wasn’t willing to get sucked in. they had another fight and nothing got resolved.</p><p>How can it get worse from here? Well, the two women did sort of agree to be April’s bridesmaids once she kicked her sister out of her bridal party.&nbsp;*Please be advised to turn away if you don’t want to read any spoilers after this point *</p><p>Next week is the wedding and with the TV show’s history of disastrous weddings then its safe to say it will not go off without a hitch:&nbsp;On the day of April’s wedding, the Grey Sloan Memorial doctors are all preoccupied with their own drama. Meredith and Cristina continue to argue about their research and careers, Bailey comes clean to Ben about her feelings regarding him moving back to Seattle, and Shane puts himself in a risky situation. Meanwhile, Derek gets a phone call that will change his life.</p><p>It’s not surprising that everyone is caught up in their own drama. Otherwise several of them by now could have fixed the rift between Meredith and Cristina. No, their complete blindness is nothing new. How their patients have survived this far is the mystery. Anyway back to poor April who after all she’s been though in her relationship with Matthew is getting married. She thought when she chose her freinds to stand by her that they would in fact stand by her. There is no peace in her kingdom unfortunately due to what the promo revealed.</p><p>Cristina has recently gotten into fighting back with Meredith. Her timing is awful. The time to tell Meredith “shut up” was two weeks ago. Not during April’s time to shine. There are limits to what a bride has to put up with. She’s already got her nerves to deal with. Then there’s Jackson whose acting strangely. It was one thing for &nbsp;April to be confused about them and their relationship but for him to start flip-flopping is too little too late.</p><p>Lastly who will create a scene at the wedding. Will it be the love triangle between Callie, Arizona, and Leah. Leah, the naive girl, thinks if she waits it out long enough then she could be in prime position when Callie splits from her wife yet again. Or can it be when Shane detonates. He’s been on the verge of a breakdown while keeping secret about Heather’s death. Meredith was concerned about him and tried to talk it over to Cristina. That”s how their argument. Cristina thought Meredith was implying she was a bad influence which she will be if she doesn’t speak to Shane. Right now she’s the closet to him and will probably be the only person he’ll confide in.</p><p>It’s time the Grey/Yang feud ended. No one has time to listen to their hurt feelings They’re usually the ones to help out their friends so it’s time they got over the disagreement either threw words or fists but it must end.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaGxnl6eyur%2BMmqWarJ%2Bixm6%2FxJqqqKZdZn1usc%2BiqqiclWJ%2Bc3nGnqtmraBiwLWtzZ1krqhdqLumrcpmp56dm2LDqrDEqGSsqJ%2Beuaa%2B0mg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-season-10-episode-12-get-up-stand-up-sneak-peek-video-and-spoilers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-season-10-episode-12-get-up-stand-up-sneak-peek-video-and-spoilers.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-season-10-episode-12-get-up-stand-up-sneak-peek-video-and-spoilers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-season-10-episode-12-get-up-stand-up-sneak-peek-video-and-spoilers.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-season-10-episode-12-get-up-stand-up-sneak-peek-video-and-spoilers.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgrey-s-anatomy-season-10-episode-12-get-up-stand-up-sneak-peek-video-and-spoilers.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./in-my-head-i-left-single-imani-wheeler-and-isiah-zay-harayda-dish-about-their-untimely.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./in-my-head-i-left-single-imani-wheeler-and-isiah-zay-harayda-dish-about-their-untimely.html>In my head, I left single: Imani Wheeler and Isiah Zay Harayda dish about their untimely</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ethel-and-lucy-s-friendship-is-not-what-it-seems.html>Ethel and Lucy's Friendship Is Not What It Seems</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ethel-and-lucy-s-friendship-is-not-what-it-seems.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
