Best known for his role as Sergeant Hank Voight on&nbsp;<a href=#>Chicago P.D</a><a href=#>.</a>, Beghe <a href=#>has had a long career in show business </a>and modeling. All this has added up to a tidy new worth. Here is how it all came about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jason-Beghe.jpg><h2 id=h-beghe-s-years-leading-up-to-chicago-pd>Beghe’s years leading up to ‘Chicago PD’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-2_49>Born in New York in 1960, Beghe began modeling following his graduation from high school. He traveled to Europe becoming the face of Armani in the 1980s, according to <a href=#>IMDb</a>. Returning to the states, Beghe began acting landing his first credited role as a state trooper in&nbsp;Thelma and Louise.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_49>A few years later he played Demi Moore’s love interest in the 1997 film,&nbsp;GI Jane. But it was on television where his acting career took off. He earned numerous gigs and guest roles on a variety of shows including&nbsp;Murder She Wrote,&nbsp;Numb3rs,&nbsp;Picket Fences,&nbsp;Melrose Place,&nbsp;Good Company,&nbsp;Chicago Hope,&nbsp;JAG,&nbsp;American Dreams,&nbsp;Everwood,&nbsp;Cane, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_65>It was in 1999 that Beghe was involved in a car crash, suffering major injuries including a broken neck, back, and ribs. He injured both lungs and was intubated while in a coma for nearly a month. When he arose from being comatose, he tried to pull out his intubation tube many times causing injury to his throat which led to his subsequent raspy voice.</p><h2 id=h-supporting-his-kids-and-ex-wife>Supporting his kids and ex-wife</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_38>Beghe married his wife, Angie Janu, in 2000. Together <a href=#>they have two sons, Bix and Bo</a>. Janu is a former model and had a short-lived acting career having appeared in one movie,&nbsp;Too Good to Be True, in 1997.</p><p id=par-6_80>In 2017, Beghe filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. Whether that was a source of his reported anger management issues or a result from them, isn’t clear. According to <a href=#>Variety</a>, in 2017 the actor was being investigated for ongoing anger issues by NBC. In 2016, multiple complaints had been made regarding Beghe’s behavior on set.&nbsp;Sent to NBCUniversal human resources, Beghe received written reprimands and was assigned an anger management coach. He made a formal apology to colleagues at the time.</p><p id=par-7_46>The terms of the divorce, which was finalized in 2020, included joint decision-making for the best interest of the minor children, according to <a href=#>People</a>. Also included were sums of $14,200 per month for Beghe to pay in child support and $16,700 per month in spousal support.</p><p id=par-8_57>Son, Bix, turns 18 this year and Janu will no longer receive the $5,320 child support payments for him beginning the month following his birthday. But at the same time, her spousal support payments will be enriched to $20,000 per month. Janu received the couple’s Malibu house in the settlement. Beghe retained ownership of their Chicago condo.</p><h2 id=h-chicago-p-d-earnings-and-net-worth>‘Chicago P.D.’ earnings and net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-9_69>Beghe started acting with the Chicago franchise in 2012, appearing as the no-nonsense Sgt. Voight in&nbsp;Chicago Fire. When the show&nbsp;Chicago P.D.&nbsp;came about in 2014, there was no doubt his character leading the intelligence team would have a major role in the series. He has appeared in crossover events with both&nbsp;Chicago P.D.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chicago Med, as well as with&nbsp;Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, all of which originated with creator Dick Wolf.</p><p id=par-10_62>For each episode of&nbsp;Chicago P.D., Beghe earns $250,000 plus royalties which equivocate to roughly $6 million per year, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Just what he earns for his appearances on the other shows is not known. In 2020, his net worth was estimated at $9 million. His ex-wife, Janu, has a net worth estimated at $1.5 million, according to <a href=#>Star Studds</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwqbXCmp6oZaBisW7Dx5qrZqGjYreiv86nZJudl52ytHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal6x62kpWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-jason-beghe-s-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-jason-beghe-s-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-jason-beghe-s-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-jason-beghe-s-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-jason-beghe-s-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-jason-beghe-s-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ai-app-maker-to-make-free-app-without-coding.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ai-app-maker-to-make-free-app-without-coding.html>AI App Maker to Make Free App without Coding</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ruel.html>Ruel</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ruel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
