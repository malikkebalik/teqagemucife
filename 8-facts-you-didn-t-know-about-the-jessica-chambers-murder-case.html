A call to emergency services reported a burning vehicle and a victim standing beside it, but that was just a small piece of a much larger puzzle.</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>As first responders rushed to the scene, they couldn’t have been prepared for what they’d be met with. The woman walking towards them had burns covering her body, charred hair, and was otherwise unrecognizable. Cole Haley, a former volunteer firefighter, was the first on the scene, and in an Oxygen docuseries, he tearfully described seeing Chambers as she tried to cry for help as she walked towards him with her arms outstretched, wearing next to nothing.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Chambers was able to mutter her name, albeit with mispronunciation due to the state of her mouth, which Haley says was black and charred inside. She was also able to say one more thing, and that statement from Chambers’ own mouth is an important one, but it’s also been at the center of a wide dispute regarding anyone familiar with the case.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>What happened to Chambers that night remains a mystery, but a few details have been central to building a case in hopes of one day bringing Chambers’ story to a complete end with the right person in custody for her murder.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jessica suffered burns on over 93% of her body</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>Chambers’ body was covered in burns when responders arrived at the scene, and medical professionals said that the body surface area burn was near 95%, with nearly all of them being 3rd degree. For reference, a 1st-degree burn is something like a sunburn, which we’ve all experienced, but a 3rd-degree burn prohibits the surface layer of skin from ever growing once again.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>Her cause of death was listed as soot and smoke inhalation and thermal injuries, with the manner of death listed as homicide.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jessica spoke this name at the scene of the crime</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>The name Chambers spoke is the highly disputed piece of evidence in the case, with good reason. While many first responders that night claimed that Chambers said “Eric” when asked who did this, further investigation led to police interviewing every Eric and Derrick in the area. The responders were attempting to ask Chambers questions in order to try to bring some sort of justice to this situation and to solve an unthinkable crime, but as has also been reported, her mouth was swollen and charred, making speech very hard.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Dr. Carolyn Wiles Higdon reported that it would have been nearly impossible for Chambers to speak with the level of injuries her body sustained, which has led people to wonder if instead of “Eric” or “Derrick,” she was trying to say “Tellis.” It was equally as impossible for those around her to hear exactly what she was trying to say.</p><h2 id=h-jessica-knew-suspect-quinton-tellis data-injectable=false>Jessica knew suspect Quinton Tellis</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>At first, Tellis tried to downplay the relationship he had with Chambers but would initially go on to admit that the pair had a sexual relationship in the weeks leading up to her murder. He says they were intimate once but had known each other for a few weeks.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>In the days after Chamber’s death, Tellis deleted every exchange the two had and would go on to delete her contact from his phone entirely, but as we all know, those messages were able to be recovered. It was then reported that Chambers told Tellis she didn’t want to have sex with him <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">four times</a> on the day she was set on fire.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>Tellis would go on to say that his removing everything in his phone relating to Chambers was because he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learned of her death</a>:</p><p>“I wasn’t scared, but after we found out who it was…who died there, I mean, I just deleted my contact with her, because I didn’t want to have a deceased person on my phone, with a number in my phone that’s just gonna be no longer used.”</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>In addition to being intimate, Tellis said he would give Chambers money for food in the weeks they knew one another.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Cell phone evidence links Jessica to Quinton at the time of her death — or does it?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>Alongside Chambers’ answering the question of “who did this,” cellphone data is another heavily debated topic in the murder case. The state says that cell phone evidence links Tellis and Chambers to being together on the night of her murder, but it’s also been reported that data that night on Tellis’ phone is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unusable</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Two responders note seeing a man at the scene that night</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>The Oxygen documentary also describes the fact that two responders at the scene said there was a middle-aged Black man who was lingering around the burning vehicle that night. When he was told he couldn’t be standing at the crime scene, he didn’t respond, never speaking a word, but he eventually walked away.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>The responders couldn’t give a description other than the details we shared above, but they agreed that he seemed suspicious. He also allegedly kept looking into the woods, at the burning car, and stared at the responder with a stare he “had never seen before,” when they first saw him, he had on a blue shirt, but as he continued walking away, the responder states that he then had a white shirt on.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>The revelation seemed as if it could have been a big one, but little else has ever been said about the man responders claim they saw that night.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>First Responders were traumatized upon arriving at the scene, especially Cole Haley</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>The most challenging part of the Oxygen series was seeing the first responders on camera, one of whom couldn’t bring himself to step foot into the courtroom for the trial. As they took the stand, many were shaking and in tears as they described seeing Chambers that night, and some of them left their careers in the wake of that night.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>Chambers being set on fire, attempting to speak, trying to mutter words to help make sense of the unspeakable crime, and the state of her body was too hard for first responders to make sense of. It is evident that everyone involved in her case has been forever changed, and Haley’s story is perhaps one of the most heartbreaking.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>As with any victim of a crime, it’s never just the victim that is impacted; it is each person whose lives they touched, and in this case, the mental and emotional health of responders is also a key piece of the case.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jessica’s death quickly became a race war</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Chambers was a girl who made friends with everyone, regardless of their race, sexuality, or circumstance, and many have said that the racial divide that happened in the wake of her murder would have been something that deeply upset her.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>“She would probably be really mad about the fact that people became so separated,” said Chamber’s neighbor and friend, Ashunta Winfield, during an Oxygen docuseries on the case.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Throughout the docuseries, podcasts, and other looks into the Chambers case, many interviewed spoke about the depth of the race war that happened. White people believed the murderer to be Black, while Black people in the community felt targeted and said it just as soon could have been a white person.</p><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=836 data-injectable=true>The town in which Chambers was killed is a town that still has an overarching sense of racism in it, and while some in the documentary dispute that it exists, there are people interviewed who are both white and Black, stating that there is a divide of sorts. Some tried to “clean it up” by saying it’s just the way it’s “always been,” while others were able to admit that the sense of racism does hang in the air; but Chambers’ death has been a catalyst in cementing that feeling in the town.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>Chambers’ mother also says that it would break her heart to see her death turning people against one another due to the color of their skin.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Quinton is a suspect in a second murder case</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>While some may say not enough evidence exists linking Tellis to Chambers’ death, there is another case in which he was suspected of murder as well. After jurors were deadlocked in both the 2017 and 2018 case of Chambers murder, he was also said to be the suspect in the murder of Ming-Chen Hsiao in 2015.</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>In a turn of events, Tellis was never charged for the stabbing death of Hsiao, and WREG Memphis describes the reason as follows:</p><p>“Fourth Judicial District Court Judge Larry Jefferson dismissed the indictment against Tellis on the basis of information that the State of Mississippi wanted Tellis to serve a five-year prison sentence for other offenses.”</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=false>Tellis did, however, plead guilty to possession of marijuana and three counts of unauthorized card use, having stolen Hsiao’s credit card on the night of her murder. As of now, a third trial for the case of Chambers is up in the air, but her family and loved ones hope that justice can be served. Her murder was one of the most horrific in the true crime realm, and those she loves deserve to feel that someone will be held responsible for her death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX216p63CrapmsZ%2BqeqW1w6erZqOepMRurcGorK1lpJ2ybrbErKqim5FisKmtzJucq6tdosKzsMSrZJyZo5p8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f8-facts-you-didn-t-know-about-the-jessica-chambers-murder-case.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f8-facts-you-didn-t-know-about-the-jessica-chambers-murder-case.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f8-facts-you-didn-t-know-about-the-jessica-chambers-murder-case.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f8-facts-you-didn-t-know-about-the-jessica-chambers-murder-case.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f8-facts-you-didn-t-know-about-the-jessica-chambers-murder-case.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f8-facts-you-didn-t-know-about-the-jessica-chambers-murder-case.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./are-keanu-reeves-alexandra-grant-still-together-details.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./are-keanu-reeves-alexandra-grant-still-together-details.html>Are Keanu Reeves, Alexandra Grant Still Together?
